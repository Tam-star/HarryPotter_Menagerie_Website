# HarryPotter_Menagerie_Website

This is what (I imagined) could have been the website of EEYLOPS OWL EMPORIUM in Harry Potter. You know, if the owner of the shop had been interested a bit in muggles' technology ðŸ˜‰

<strong>Technologies : HTML, CSS / Sass / Javascript</strong>

Most of the images are from https://pottermore.fandom.com/wiki/Pottermore_Wiki (except for one which is from Pixabay)

Information like prices and the adress of the shop, I found on these websites :
